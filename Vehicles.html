      <P class=textbox>      
Battle Rating (BR) in War Thunder is a system used to balance matches by assigning a numerical value to each vehicle based on its combat effectiveness. The Battle Rating determines which vehicles a player can encounter in battles, ensuring that they face opponents of similar capability.   </P>

           <P class=textbox>Matchmaking: When queuing for battles, War Thunder's matchmaking system uses the Battle Ratings of the vehicles in your lineup to create balanced teams. Vehicles with similar Battle Ratings are matched together in battles.

Balance: The Battle Rating takes into account various factors such as firepower, armor protection, speed, and other combat capabilities. Vehicles with stronger attributes generally have a higher Battle Rating.

Adjustments: Gaijin Entertainment, the developer of War Thunder, periodically adjusts the Battle Ratings of vehicles based on performance data and player feedback. This helps maintain a fair and enjoyable gameplay experience by ensuring that overpowered or underpowered vehicles are appropriately balanced.

Tiers: Battle Ratings are associated with specific vehicle tiers, which represent different technological eras and vehicle types. As players progress through the game, they unlock and access vehicles from higher tiers, each with its own Battle Rating range.</P>
